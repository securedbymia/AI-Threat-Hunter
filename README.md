# 🛡️ AI Threat Hunter

A cybersecurity research project designed to explore the intersection of machine learning, anomaly detection, and real-time threat analysis, while explaining threats in plain English. The system ingests network traffic data, detects unusual behavior, classifies threats, and lays the foundation for LLM-powered contextual explanations — all aimed at automating parts of the threat hunting process.

## 🚧 Project Progress
